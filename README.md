# Sierpi´nski Triangle

Lets use python/streamlit to visualise the creation of a Sierpi´nski triangle using the chaos game.

## The chaos game.

1. Take three points in a plane to form a triangle
2. Randomly select any point inside the triangle.
3. Randomly select any of the three vertex points.
4. Move half of the distance from your current position to the selecter vertex.
5. Plot the current position.
6. Repeat from step 3.

## Start locations and possible results

this section will go report on exerimenting with different startpoints and there influence on the game. 

## How this program selects a random point in the triangle.
